                 Immersion 2.5.

                 
   request:get a list of students
   url:/students 
   respond format:JSON             

 GET
 
 
 The first line of code routes the request to the server, while the second line of code defines the format of the response that the server will send back. Think back to the table with all the request and response body data from above. For all GET requests to the “/students” URL endpoint, it specified that the server should return “a JSON object holding data about all the students”


 POST

 This time, the code is routed for POST requests. The code takes data from the request (in this case, data about a new student) and adds it as a new element to the array already on the server (students.push(newStudent);). (If this application connected to an external database rather than storing the data in-memory, you’d be adding the element to that database instead.)
